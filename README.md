# Volatility-Puzzle-in-Equity-Return-
Python Code for our Applied Finance Project (2017)

Volatility Puzzle in Equity Return is the project carried by Qiuyi CHEN, Russell DING, Zongyi GONG, Jong-Myun MOON, and Shihong WEN, and advised by Prof. David Sraer. The project investigates a set of related investment anomalies in which higher risk taking appears not to be compensated by greater returns. The team carefully applies cross-sectional techniques to robustly decompose the puzzle into its short-term vs. long-term, systematic vs. idiosyncratic, and frictional sources. They also find that the signal associated with the puzzle has decreased significantly since the research which originally identified it appeared and explore the reasons why this might be the case.
